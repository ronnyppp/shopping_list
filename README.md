📱 Shopping List App (Flutter)

A simple shopping list application built using Flutter and Firebase Realtime Database, based on the Flutter & Dart course by Academind (Maximilian Schwarzmüller) on Udemy.

The app allows users to:

 - Add, view, and delete grocery items

 - Categorize items with color-coded labels

 - Persist data in real time using Firebase

 - Fetch and update data asynchronously via HTTP requests

This project helped reinforce core Flutter concepts such as:

 - Stateful widgets and widget lifecycle

 - Async/await and error handling

 - RESTful interaction with Firebase

 - Form validation and input handling

 - Clean UI layout and theming in Flutter

Built as a learning project to practice Flutter fundamentals and backend integration.
